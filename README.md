# Template Matching
Template is primarily a sub-part of an object thatâ€Ÿs to be matched amongst entirely different objects. Template matching is a technique in digital image processing for finding the template image.

General categorizations of template or image matching approaches are Featured-based approach and Template or Area based approach.

# Implementation
Here I have implemented 3 different algorithms for Template based Image Matching:
1. Exhaustive Search
2. Hierarchical Search
3. Logarithmic 2D Search
